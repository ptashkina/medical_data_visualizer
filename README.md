In this project, I visualize and make calculations from medical examination data.

* **Python libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn. 
* **Data source:** [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

The project was made during the course [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/#data-analysis-with-python-projects)
